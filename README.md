## Usage

### Getting the CSS file
You can either download the CSS file from the [Releases](https://github.com/SebastianAigner/twemoji-amazing/releases/latest) page, or use a CDN such as JsDelivr:
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/SebastianAigner/twemoji-amazing@1.2.0/twemoji-amazing.css
```

### Using the CSS classes

`<i class="twa twa-face-with-monocle">`

### Size Options

Like Font-Awesome (and Twemoji-Awesome), emoji sizes can be changed via `twa-lg`, `twa-2x`, `twa-3x`, `twa-4x`, and `twa-5x`.

### Finding Emojis

- Twemoji-Amazing uses [Emoji.json](https://github.com/amio/emoji.json) as its source of codepoints and descriptions.
- To find an emoji of your liking, check out the [official Emoji list](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-list.html). Replace spaces with hyphens to get the class name! (e.g. "film projector" becomes `twa-film-projector` ðŸ“½)

_Note for Twemoji-Awesome users: Twemoji-Amazing is designed to be an almost-no-adjustments-needed replacement for twemoji-awesome. However, the naming scheme for twemoji-awesome was based on [Emoji Cheat Sheet](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/), which is now outdated. This means some emojis might have changed names._

### Running the generator

`./gradlew run` will generate a fresh version of the twemoji-amazing file in the root directory of the project.
